            <div className="history-text">
              <p>
                <strong>Pamantasan ng Cabuyao (PNC)</strong> was established in 2001 through 
                City Ordinance No. 2001-012, making it the first and only local university 
                in the City of Cabuyao, Laguna. The university was born out of the vision 
                to provide accessible and quality higher education to the residents of 
                Cabuyao and nearby municipalities.
              </p>
              <p>
                Starting with just a handful of programs and a few hundred students, PNC 
                has grown exponentially over the years. The university initially offered 
                teacher education programs and has since expanded to include engineering, 
                business administration, computer science, and various other fields of study.
              </p>
              <p>
                In 2010, PNC achieved a significant milestone by earning Level II 
                Accreditation from the Accrediting Agency of Chartered Colleges and 
                Universities in the Philippines (AACCUP). This recognition validated the 
                university's commitment to excellence in education.
              </p>
              <p>
                Today, PNC stands as a testament to the power of quality education in 
                transforming lives and communities. With modern facilities, qualified 
                faculty members, and a student-centered approach to learning, the university 
                continues to produce graduates who are not only academically competent but 
                also socially responsible and globally competitive.
              </p>
              <p>
                The university has also been active in community extension services, 
                partnering with local government units and organizations to address 
                community needs through various outreach programs, skills training, and 
                sustainable development initiatives.
